## **PRESENTATION**
- SELECTED TOPIC
- REASON FOR SELECTED TOPIC
- DESCRIPTION OF THE SOURCE DATA
- QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO ANSWER WITH THE DATA
[^]: Note: the content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation; text in the README.md works as well.

## **GITHUB**
- INCLUDES A README.md with:
  - Description of the communication protocols
- INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES
  - At least one branch for each team member
  - Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment
[^]: Note: The descritpions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

## **MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**
- TEAM MEMBERS PRESENT A PROVISIONAL MACHINE LEARNING MODEL THAT STANDS IN FOR THE FINAL MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND ACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING:
  - Sample data that mimics the expecteed final database structure or schema
  - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

### *Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  Was able to use three layers with 80 and 20 neurons with relu activation.  The final Output layer utilized sigmoid for the best result.
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  Yes I was able to acheive 79.2% accuracy which is greater than the target model performance of 75%
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  The biggest impact of change was adding back the column Name that was previously excluded from the original model.  Then had to trim the number of     instances for the program to run without crashing.

## **DASHBOARD**
